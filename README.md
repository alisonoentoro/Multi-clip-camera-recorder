# ðŸ“¹ Multi Clip Camera Recorder 

A web-based camera recording application that allows you to record multiple video clips and seamlessly combine them into a single high-quality video file.

Created with Gemini and Claude. 

### Process 

Phase 1: Full screen camera with basic recording + save functionality

Phase 2: Multi-clip workflow with undo/save buttons appearing after first recording

Phase 3: Drag-and-drop clip management system for reordering

Phase 4: Enhanced playback quality and download functionality

Phase 5: Add Countdown Timer and MP4 video quality

Phase 6: MPEG4 capability for Quicktime video playback (only works for single clip and must use a MP4 convertor for multi-clip video)

Phase 7: Clip Management to include ability to delete video and video playback on individual clips
